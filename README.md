# UK_Road_Accident_Data_Analysis
The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization tool that provides valuable insights into road accidents in the United Kingdom for the years 2021 and 2022. This project aims to present a clear and concise overview of road accident data, focusing on primary and secondary key performance indicators (KPIs) to enable stakeholders to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to improve road safety.

Primary KPIs:
Total Casualties: The dashboard showcases the total number of casualties that occurred after road accidents in the UK during 2021 and 2022. This essential KPI gives a holistic view of the impact of accidents on public safety and serves as a primary indicator of the overall severity of road accidents.
Casualties by Accident Severity: The dashboard provides a breakdown of casualties based on the accident severity levels, such as fatal, serious, and slight injuries. This segmentation allows users to understand the distribution of accidents by severity and identify areas where interventions are most urgently needed.
Maximum Casualties by Vehicle Type: The dashboard highlights the vehicle types that recorded the highest number of casualties. This information is crucial for identifying high-risk vehicle categories and devising targeted safety measures to reduce casualties related to specific vehicles.

Secondary KPIs:
Casualties by Vehicle Type: The dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of casualties categorized by different types of vehicles. This breakdown helps in understanding which vehicle types are involved in the most accidents and aids in formulating vehicle-specific safety strategies.
Monthly Trend Comparison: The dashboard includes a month-to-month comparison of casualties for the current year (2022) and the previous year (2021). This temporal analysis reveals seasonal patterns and identifies any changes in accident trends over time.
Additional Insights: In addition to the primary and secondary KPIs, the dashboard offers several other valuable insights, such as location-specific accident analysis, time-of-day patterns, analysis of contributing factors (e.g., weather conditions, road type), and more.

Benefits and Impact:
The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard serves as a powerful tool for various stakeholders, including government agencies, law enforcement, transportation departments, and safety organizations. By presenting vital KPIs and trends in a visually appealing and easily understandable format, the dashboard enables the following benefits:
Data-Driven Decision Making: The stakeholders can make data-driven decisions and allocate resources more effectively by identifying high-risk areas, vehicles, and time periods for road accidents.
Proactive Road Safety Measures: Armed with accurate insights, authorities can implement targeted road safety campaigns and measures to reduce casualties and improve overall road safety across the UK.
Public Awareness: The dashboard can be used to raise public awareness about road safety issues, encouraging responsible driving behaviors and promoting safety precautions.
